comboLock Class:
    Responsibilities:
        set lock with code
        reset the dial
        turn left with given number of ticks
        turn right with given number of ticks
        open lock

    Constructor:
        create empty list for order and code
    Methods:
        combolock:
            param: secret1, secret2, secret3
            store secrets to code
        reset:
            clear order and code list
        turnLeft:
            param: ticks
            if the ticks are valid ticks:
                append 'left', number of turn to order list
        turnRight:
            param: ticks
            if the ticks are valid ticks:
                append 'right', number of turn to order list
        open:
            check if the length of turns is == length of the code and the order is correct (right, left, right)
                    iterate through the order
                        if not the order at index is same as the code at index
                            break
                    else
                        return true
            return false
